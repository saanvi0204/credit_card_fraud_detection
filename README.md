# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Hybrid Autoencoder Model 
The project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset. <br/>
• Implemented an autoendcoder for unsupervised learning anomaly detection. <br/>
• Compared various supervised ensemble models for better classification. <br/>
• Used latent (encoded) features and reconstruction error as inputs for ensemble models. <br/>
• Trained different ensemble models using labeled data. <br/>
• Finally, integrated LightGBM for the classification.
